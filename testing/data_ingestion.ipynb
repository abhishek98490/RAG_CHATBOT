      "Understanding Climate Change  \n",
      "Chapter 1: Introduction to Climate Change  \n",
      "Climate change refers to significant, long -term changes in the global climate. The term \n",
      "\"global climate\" encompasses the planet's overall weather patterns, including temperature, \n",
      "precipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past cent ury, human \n",
      "activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \n",
      "contributed to climate change.  \n",
      "Historical Context  \n",
      "The Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \n",
      "been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \n",
      "11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and  human civilization. \n",
      "Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that \n",
      "change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \n",
      "began at the end of the last ice age, human societies f lourished, but the industrial era has seen \n",
      "unprecedented changes.  \n",
      "Modern Observations  \n",
      "Modern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \n",
      "and extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \n",
      "documented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \n",
      "provide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \n",
      "predict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \n",
      "driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases.  \n",
      "Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  \n",
      "Greenhouse Gases  \n",
      "The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \n",
      "atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \n",
      "oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is  essential \n",
      "for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \n",
      "activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.  \n",
      "Fossil Fuels  \n",
      "Burning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \n",
      "natural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \n",
      "the beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \n",
      "today.  \n",
      "Coal  \n",
      "Coal is the most carbon -intensive fossil fuel, and its use for electricity generation is a major \n",
      "source of CO2 emissions. Despite a decline in some regions, coal remains a significant \n",
      "energy source globally. It is mined extensively in countries like China,  India, and the United \n",
      "States, contributing significantly to their energy supplies and CO2 footprints.  \n",
      "Oil \n",
      "Oil is used primarily for transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. The combustion of \n",
      "oil products releases significant amounts of CO2 and other pollutants, contributing to climate \n",
      "change and air quality issues. The global oil industry is vast, in volving extraction, refining, \n",
      "and distribution, with significant geopolitical and economic implications.  \n",
      "Natural Gas  \n",
      "Natural gas is the least carbon -intensive fossil fuel and is often seen as a \"bridge fuel\" to a \n",
      "lower -carbon future. However, its extraction and use still contribute to greenhouse gas \n",
      "emissions, particularly methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas. Innov ations in fracking \n",
      "technology have made natural gas more accessible, but this comes with environmental and \n",
      "health concerns.  \n",
      "Deforestation  \n",
      "Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When trees are cut down \n",
      "for timber or to clear land for agriculture, this stored carbon is released back into the \n",
      "atmosphere. Deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2, exa cerbating the \n",
      "greenhouse effect.  \n",
      "Tropical Deforestation  \n",
      "Tropical rainforests are particularly important for carbon storage. Deforestation in the \n",
      "Amazon, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia has significant impacts on global carbon cycles \n",
      "and biodiversity. These regions are often cleared for agriculture, logging, and  mining, leading \n",
      "to habitat loss and species extinction.  \n",
      "Boreal Forests  \n",
      "Boreal forests, found in the northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia, also play a \n",
      "crucial role in sequestering carbon. Logging and land -use changes in these regions contribute \n",
      "to climate change. These forests are vital for regulating the Earth' s climate and supporting \n",
      "indigenous communities and wildlife.  \n",
      "Agriculture  \n",
      "Agriculture contributes to climate change through methane emissions from livestock, rice \n",
      "paddies, and the use of synthetic fertilizers. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a much \n",
      "higher heat -trapping capability than CO2, albeit in smaller quantities.  \n",
      "Livestock Emissions  \n",
      "Ruminant animals, such as cows and sheep, produce methane during digestion. Manure \n",
      "management practices also contribute to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Innovations in \n",
      "livestock feeding and waste management can help mitigate these emissions.  \n",
      "Rice Cultivation  \n",
      "Flooded rice paddies create anaerobic conditions that lead to methane production. Improved \n",
      "water management and rice varieties can help reduce these emissions. Research into \n",
      "sustainable rice farming practices is crucial for balancing food security and clim ate goals.  \n",
      "Fertilizers  \n",
      "The use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. \n",
      "Practices such as precision farming and organic fertilizers can mitigate these emissions. The \n",
      "development of eco -friendly fertilizers and farming techniques is  essential for reducing the \n",
      "agricultural sector's carbon footprint.  \n",
      "Chapter 3: Effects of Climate Change  \n",
      "The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world and are projected to \n",
      "intensify in the coming decades. These effects include:  \n",
      "Rising Temperatures  \n",
      "Global temperatures have risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since \n",
      "the late 19th century. This warming is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more \n",
      "significant increases than others.  \n",
      "Heatwaves  \n",
      "Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe, posing risks to human health, agriculture, \n",
      "and infrastructure. Cities are particularly vulnerable due to the \"urban heat island\" effect. \n",
      "Heatwaves can lead to heat -related illnesses and exacerbate existing h ealth conditions.  \n",
      "Changing Seasons  \n",
      "Climate change is altering the timing and length of seasons, affecting ecosystems and human \n",
      "activities. For example, spring is arriving earlier, and winters are becoming shorter and \n",
      "milder in many regions. This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles a nd agricultural \n",
      "practices.  \n",
      "Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels  \n",
      "Warmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising \n",
      "sea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century, \n",
      "threatening coastal communities and ecosystems.  \n",
      "Polar Ice Melt  \n",
      "The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, leading to significant ice \n",
      "loss. Antarctic ice sheets are also losing mass, contributing to sea level rise. This melting \n",
      "affects global ocean currents and weather patterns.  \n",
      "Glacial Retreat  \n",
      "Glaciers around the world are retreating, affecting water supplies for millions of people. \n",
      "Regions dependent on glacial meltwater, such as the Himalayas and the Andes, face \n",
      "particular risks. Glacial melt also impacts hydropower generation and agriculture.  \n",
      "Coastal Erosion  \n",
      "Rising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion, threatening \n",
      "homes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Low -lying islands and coastal regions are especially \n",
      "vulnerable. Coastal communities must invest in adaptation measures like s ea walls and \n",
      "managed retreats.  \n",
      "Extreme Weather Events  \n",
      "Climate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather \n",
      "events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events can have \n",
      "devastating impacts on communities, economies, and ecosystems.  \n",
      "Hurricanes and Typhoons  \n",
      "Warmer ocean temperatures can intensify hurricanes and typhoons, leading to more \n",
      "destructive storms. Coastal regions are at heightened risk of storm surge and flooding. Early \n",
      "warning systems and resilient infrastructure are critical for mitigating these ri sks. \n",
      "Droughts  \n",
      "Increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are contributing to more frequent \n",
      "and severe droughts. This affects agriculture, water supply, and ecosystems, particularly in \n",
      "arid and semi -arid regions. Droughts can lead to food and water shorta ges and exacerbate \n",
      "conflicts.  \n",
      "Flooding  \n",
      "Heavy rainfall events are becoming more common, leading to increased flooding. Urban \n",
      "areas with poor drainage and infrastructure are particularly at risk. Flood management \n",
      "strategies include improved drainage systems, green infrastructure, and floodplain r estoration.  \n",
      "Ocean Acidification  \n",
      "Increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere lead to higher concentrations of CO2 in the oceans. \n",
      "This causes the water to become more acidic, which can harm marine life, particularly \n",
      "organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and some s hellfish.  \n",
      "Coral Reefs  \n",
      "Coral reefs are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and acidity. Ocean acidification \n",
      "and warming waters contribute to coral bleaching and mortality, threatening biodiversity and \n",
      "fisheries. Protecting and restoring coral reefs is essential for marine  conservation.  \n",
      "Marine Ecosystems  \n",
      "Acidification affects the health and survival of various marine species, disrupting food webs \n",
      "and ecosystems. This has implications for commercial fisheries and the livelihoods of people \n",
      "who depend on the ocean. Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and enhance marine protected \n",
      "areas are vital.  \n",
      "Chapter 4: Mitigation and Adaptation  \n",
      "Addressing climate change requires a two -pronged approach: mitigation and adaptation. \n",
      "Mitigation involves reducing or preventing the emission of greenhouse gases, while \n",
      "adaptation involves making adjustments to social, economic, and environmental practices  to \n",
      "minimize the damage caused by climate change.  \n",
      "Renewable Energy  \n",
      "Transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, is \n",
      "crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These sources produce little to no emissions \n",
      "and are sustainable in the long term.  \n",
      "Solar Power  \n",
      "Solar power harnesses energy from the sun using photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems. \n",

      "Why the Indian economy is ‘buzzing with energy and optimism’\n",
      "Even as tariffs and other shocks are expected to rattle the global economy in 2025, India will likely remain insulated. Thanks to a strong push in manufacturing and infrastructure, the Indian economy is “buzzing with energy and optimism,” says James Reynolds of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n",
      "“With domestic consumption accounting for 70% of its GDP, India has historically been viewed as more vulnerable to high inflation,” says Reynolds , global head of direct lending. “However, India has in recent years performed better than various developed and emerging economies in relation to its inflation targets, largely a result of a stronger government, central bank, and improving financial system.”\n",
      "To get the pulse of the Indian economy, Reynolds, Stephanie Hui, head of private and growth equity in Asia Pacific for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and Hiren Dasani, co-head of emerging markets equity for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, led a tour of clients and investors through three cities. The four-day tour included discussions with top corporate executives, up-and-coming start-up founders, and policymakers.\n",
      "We spoke with Hui, Dasani, and Reynolds about the prospects for India’s economy, the thrust in infrastructure and manufacturing, and the private equity sector’s view of India.\n",
      "Tell us a little more about the investor tour, and the overall mood you encountered.\n",
      "Hiren Dasani: It was 22 investors representing $4 four trillion in assets under management as of November 2024 . The clients had come all over from all over the world: about 50% from the Americas, I would say, and about 25% from the EMEA region, and the remaining from the Asia-Pacific region. A very large proportion of the clients were public pension funds from the US and some of the largest family offices as well.\n",
      "I think the mood was very optimistic from a medium-term perspective, and that was evident from the meetings we did with corporate leaders. There’s a sense that India may be becoming more competitive on manufacturing. Historically, services was the main driver of consumption, but now manufacturing competitiveness has been more pronounced, especially in a world where many large corporations are looking to diversify their supply chain. “China plus one” is a theme that a lot of corporates like.\n",
      "What has led to this boost in manufacturing competitiveness?\n",
      "Hiren Dasani: Some of this is related to production-linked incentive schemes, which India has rolled out over the years. There are tax incentives if a company sets up new production capacity in India, with certain production targets: up to 5-6% of the value of the output for a certain number of initial years.\n",
      "Over and above that, I’d say there are more structural reforms like investments in renewable energy, which makes energy costs more competitive, and in logistics infrastructure.\n",
      "Stephanie Hui: The diversification of supply chains has been a key driver of India’s growth prospect. Prior to Covid, people were happy basically sourcing primarily from China for manufactured goods. However, with the disruptions from Covid and geopolitics, business leaders have increasingly sought diversification. Historically, India was more costly, but people are now saying that, if you need diversification, there’s more tolerance for higher costs and more patience for India to get up the learning curve.\n",
      "Unlike some smaller manufacturing markets, India has a large home base. So that the procurement power is such that, when you get to scale, it will likely become price competitive. I believe that's the reason why there's optimism that, if they can do dial up manufacturing, it may benefit India but may also benefit other international companies trying to risk manage. They had already, long ago, started sourcing IT services, so this is a continuation on that spectrum.\n",
      "How is the Indian government’s strong capex focus on infrastructure contributing to this story?\n",
      "James Reynolds: The government has significantly ramped up its capital expenditure on infrastructure, allocating a record 11 trillion rupees ($134 billion) on infrastructure spend for the fiscal year ending March 2025. In recent years, it has launched several large-scale projects in areas such as energy, urban development, transportation, digital infrastructure which includes expansion of highways, development of new airports, creation of smart cities, and investment in renewable energy.\n",
      "Hiren Dasani: We met one of the largest infrastructure companies in India, which has been involved in railway electrification, bullet train projects, airport buildouts, and so forth. And in all of them, they were highlighting that the pace of execution has picked up quite a bit. So just to give you some numbers: Data center capacity is likely to grow by a factor of six or seven in the next five years, we believe. And while India has built metro rail systems in 17 cities in the last 50 years, more than 20 cities at present are developing metro rail networks.\n",
      "Why are many Indian companies today focusing on vertical integration?\n",
      "Hiren Dasani: This is more true of startups, really. In developed countries, a startup founder gets many things on a platter, because the physical infrastructure and the overall ecosystem (including supply chain networks and pools of talented human resources) are typically better developed. So the founder can just focus on one thing and doing that extremely well. But in an emerging market like India, where the broader ecosystem is not that well developed, you might spend more time and resources in developing that ecosystem. Which leads you to be a little more vertically integrated.\n",
      "Stephanie Hui: I’d also add that there’s support from the government to move upstream. I’ll use an anecdote here. Historically, Indian manufacturing companies have imported major parts, primarily from China, and assembled locally. The software may have been Indian, but the hardware was primarily sourced from outside. But what we’re seeing right now is, for some products, a cap on the percentage of components coming from outside the country, versus being manufactured domestically. The government uses tax and other incentives to drive this change.\n",
      "The example that was quoted on our trip was HVAC systems: heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems that people use. Historically you could import most of the parts, but now some of the copper tubing and hardware pieces have to be sourced domestically.\n",
      "What were the big takeaways for private credit?\n",
      "James Reynolds: Total outstanding private sector lending increased approximately 5x over the last 13 years to $2.5 trillion at the end of 2023 — and we may just be at the beginning. There has been a strong thesis supporting growth of the sector in India. Sponsors have remained bullish on the long-term potential of India, which will likely continue to drive M&A activity. That could result in greater financing needs, particularly offshore financing, as regulations restrict ability of onshore lenders to finance acquisitions.\n",
      "Second, we believe companies need to continue investing to meet the growing global and domestic demand. With India’s nominal GDP expected to grow to $7 trillion by 2030, the total incremental demand for private credit is expected to be another $2.6 trillion. Excluding the 60% that was historically provided by banks, this implies an additional $1 trillion to be financed by the bond market and non-bank market and represents a large opportunity for private credit lenders.\n",
      "What did you see and hear on the private equity side of things?\n",
      "Stephanie Hui: In this region, obviously China has historically been the primary destination for private equity, but in recent years, there has been more of a diversification, with increased flow to Japan, India, and Australia. Of these three markets, many investors feel Japan is a more developed market. India's exciting as a developing market, but that also comes with developing market risks. There’s a tremendous will to try to understand the Indian market.\n",
      "The major theme we have seen is what we call IT services to the world, because the skilled labor cost in India is about a fifth or sixth of what it is in the US. Here, PE players may start with an Indian company, but when they exit eventually, given many of IT clients are US and European companies, they can exit as international players.\n",
      "If you look at the private equity space, there are some sizable and successful exits from India. You see proper exits coming through.\n",
      "The other focus is on capital markets, because India’s capital markets are very vibrant and have grown quite substantially in terms of value over the last two years in particular. The flip side of this is that everybody's asking the question: Is India too expensive now? For some of the consumer market deals, you were seeing companies trading at a premium of 25-30x EBITDA. Along with the US, India is possibly the most highly priced market in the world. The question that comes through is: Is it well-priced? Is it a time to exit versus a time to enter? And where do you get good value?\n",
      "James Reynolds: While there has been a consistent debate as to whether the Indian stock market is too expensive, we believe valuations in India are in general still very healthy. This is driving families and founders to look for an alternative source of capital that is less dilutive than equity.\n",
      "Hiren Dasani: I'll just add one point on the valuation, and this is not so much from the tour — but the way we’ve tried to frame valuations in public markets is that there’s a stronger-for-longer nature of growth in India today. It’s much less volatile, much more structural, domestic-consumption-driven growth rather than global cyclically driven growth. Also, more benign as inflation leads to a lower cost of capital. So all of this, we believe, bring valuations to where they are.\n",
      "If you look at the luxury hotel sector, when the US economy went from $3.6 trillion to $7.3 trillion between 1983 and 1994, the number of hotels of a particular chain went up by seven times. In Europe, similarly, when GDP went from $3.7 trillion to $7.1 trillion, the number of hotels of another chain went up by a factor of four. India is at a similar stage of economic development in terms of absolute GDP and, on many measures, per capita GDP as well. We believe a lot of discretionary spending will grow exponentially over time, and that’s what leads to these kinds of valuations in the market.\n",
      "What constraints, if any, do you see in the economy?\n",
      "Stephanie Hui: There are some discussions about labor force participation. In the south of India, there seems to be more female participation in the labor force, and you see an improvement of GDP per capita there, versus in the north. The other topic is: Obviously it's an English-speaking workforce, and particularly in IT services, that's very helpful. But there's also a lot of debate about the efficiency of the workforce, versus China, particularly in manufacturing. India's manufacturing productivity is lower. And in lifting people en masse from poverty, manufacturing tends to be the important sector to do so.\n",
      "James Reynolds: The biggest potential impediment to India’s growth would be its ability to control the pace of infrastructure development as gaps in connectivity and logistics often can have a big impact on business operations, costs, and quality of life. We believe India’s ability to prioritize large-scale infrastructure projects and urban development and increase public-private partnerships to expedite infrastructure development would be key.\n",
      "There is also a delicate balance between job productivity and job creation that the country will need to achieve. While digitalization has helped improved productivity, the lack of sufficient job opportunities has the potential to lead to longer term socio-economic instability albeit the effect of this has been somewhat offset by the slower urbanization in India.\n",
