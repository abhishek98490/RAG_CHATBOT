# RAG Chatbot Project (Under Development)

This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot project that allows users to upload `.txt`, `.docx`, and extractable `.pdf` documents. The extracted content from these documents can be used to chat with a **Large Language Model (LLM)** for querying and conversation based on the uploaded content.

## Features (Planned)

- **Document Upload & Processing**: Users will be able to upload `.txt`, `.docx`, and `.pdf` files.
- **Text Extraction**: The content from the uploaded documents will be extracted and prepared for use.
- **Chat Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot and ask questions based on the uploaded document contents.
- **Real-time Information Retrieval**: The chatbot will provide responses based on the extracted text from the documents.
